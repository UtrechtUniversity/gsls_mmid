# Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases 

R-codes for practicals of the course Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases.

There are two ways of using these materials:
1. Use the word documents in docs
   ```
   ├── docs
   ..   ├── Practical Deterministic Models.docx
        ├── Practical Deterministic Models Answerkey.docx
        ├── Practical Stochastic Models.docx
        └── Practical Stochastic Models Answerkey.docx
   with the R-code in
   └── R
    ..  ├── Det_no_Demo.R (deterministic no demography)
        ├── Det_with_Demo.R (deterministic with demography)
        ├── Stoch_no_Demo.R (stochastic no demography)
        └── Stoch_no_Demo.R (stochastic with demography)
   ```
or 
2. Use the R-markdown or notebook version which includes the questions:
```
    └── R
    ..  ├── PracticalDeterministic.Rmd (deterministic markdown)
        ├── PracticalDeterministic.nb (deterministic notebook)
        ├── PracticalStochastic.Rmd (deterministic markdown)
        └── PracticalStochastic.nb (stochastic notebook)
```
